# Git Setup Commands

## After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Octalogic-Tech/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# Push to the main/master branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: If repository already has content
```bash
# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Octalogic-Tech/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# Pull existing content first (if any)
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Push your changes
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository Structure Ready for Push:
✅ Frontend: Next.js application with TypeScript
✅ Backend: Express.js API with TypeScript  
✅ Documentation: Setup guides and task breakdown
✅ Environment: Templates for all integrations
✅ Git: Proper .gitignore and initial commit

## Next Steps After Push:
1. Set up CI/CD workflows
2. Configure environment variables in deployment
3. Set up database migrations
4. Configure Firebase project
5. Set up Shopify development store
